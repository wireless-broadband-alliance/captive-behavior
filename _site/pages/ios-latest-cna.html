<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The standard flow for the Captive Network authentication process starts with Wi-Fi association. It doesn’t matter what kind of Wi-Fi association protocol is used (Hotspot 2.0 or other), in all cases just after the association is complete, the device makes a request for an IP-address (DHCP DISCOVER).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>After receiving an IP-address, the device goes to check <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html</code> (exact domain and URI could be different from this one: see appendix for complete list) via so-called CNA Helper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In this request the device uses a specific User-Agent: “CaptiveNetworkSupport-355.200.27 wispr” (the version mentioned could be different). The received answer is analyzed to verify if the existence of Web-authorization and in case of detection, Wi-Fi network marks as captive (appropriate switches appears in the network settings), and switching from cellular connection to Wi-Fi doesn’t appear otherwise the device switches to the Wi-Fi connection as major one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the case of association with a known Captive Network SSID when the device is not active (in a locked state in a pocket, for example), there are no further requests produced by device before unlocking. After this device is unlocked, additional checking requests are made and in case of Web-authorization confirms, CPMB is rising.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When CPMB is risen it generate additional request to http://captive.apple.com/hotspot-detect.html (see appendix for complete list) but with different kind of User-Agent: “Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 12_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/16A366” (the version mentioned could be different). During authorization process in CPMB, almost all network actions followed by additional checks of current state.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When the CPMB detects that the captive domain is accessible, it changes the control button in the top right corner from “Cancel” to “Done” and switches the primary connection from cellular network to Wi-Fi. The CPMB only performs a check of the captive domain after a full URL navigation or by timer. A javascript-triggered AJAX call for example will not result in the CPMB performing an additional check of the captive domain. With a single page app that does not redirect to a separate post-authentication landing page, a full page navigation must occur for the CPMB to change the control button from “Cancel’ to “Done”. If this doesn’t happen, the user’s device will be authenticated and connected to Wi-Fi but the CPMB will only provide the “Cancel” option, which will disassociate the device from the SSID and take the user back the Wi-Fi network selection screen in the Settings menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sometimes, after several connections to the Wi-Fi network without Captive Portal with the same SSID as used in Captive Network, iOS may switch off Captive Checker for this particular SSID and there will no Captive Browser rising</p>
